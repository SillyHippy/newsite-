Yes, let's get your site running in the next 5 minutes with the simplest possible approach:

### Quick Fix:

1. **Go to your repository on GitHub**

2. **Create a new workflow file:**
   - Navigate to `.github/workflows/`
   - Click "Add file" â†’ "Create new file"
   - Name it `deploy-pages.yml`

3. **Copy and paste this exact content:**
```yml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2
        with:
          path: '.'
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

4. **Click "Commit changes..."** to save the file

5. **Delete the old workflow file** that's causing errors

This simplified workflow uses properly matched versions that will work together without dependency issues. It should deploy your site within minutes of being committed.
